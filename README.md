# Lasca

A browser-based implementation of Lasca (also known as Laska), the strategic board game invented by World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker in 1911.

## About

This project implements three checkers variants:

### Lasca (7×7 and 8×8)

Lasca is a two-player checkers variant with unique stacking mechanics. When a piece captures an opponent's piece, it forms a stack (called a "column") with the captured piece underneath. The top piece controls the stack, and captured pieces can be liberated when their stack is captured.

- Play on classic 7×7 board or Lasca 8×8 variant
- Soldiers move forward; Officers move diagonally any direction
- Captured pieces form stacks rather than leaving the board

### Dama (8×8)

Traditional checkers/draughts with two rule variants:

- **Standard**: Captured pieces removed immediately during multi-capture sequences
- **International**: Captured pieces remain on board until sequence completes
- Men move forward diagonally; Kings have "flying" movement (any distance diagonally)
- Save files are compatible between Standard and International variants
- Mandatory capture with maximum-capture rule (must take the longest capture sequence)

### Damasca (8×8)

Damasca combines Dama-style movement with Lasca-style stacking captures:

- Dama-style movement (including flying Officers)
- Lasca-style stacking captures (jump takes top piece only and adds it to the bottom of the capturing stack)
- Mandatory capture + multi-capture + maximum-capture priority
- Promotion is applied at end of turn / end of capture chain (no mid-chain king powers)

## How to Play

### Starting the Game

1. Run the dev server with `npm start` (it opens the Start Page at `src/index.html`)
2. Choose options (theme, startup toggles, AI), then click **Launch**

- If you choose the **Glass** theme, you can also choose **Glass bg** (**Original** / **Felt** / **Walnut**).
- If you choose the **Glass** theme, you can also choose **Glass colors** (piece color-pair presets).

#### Online multiplayer (Create / Join)

1. Start the online dev server + client with `npm run online:dev`

- Client: `http://localhost:8080/`
- Server: `http://localhost:8788/`

Note: if `8080` is already in use, Vite will pick another port (often `8081`). Use the URL printed in your terminal.

2. On the Start Page, set **Play mode** to **Online**.
3. Player 1 chooses **Create**, chooses **Room** visibility (**Public** or **Private**), and clicks **Launch**.
4. After the room is created, the game shows a sticky **Waiting for opponent…** toast. Tap it to copy an invite link to share.
5. You can also copy the **Room ID** from **Info → Online** (copy button next to “Room ID”).
6. Player 2 can either open the invite link, or go to the Start Page → **Join**, paste the Room ID, and click **Launch**.

#### Spectating (Start Page)

- For **public** rooms, choose **Online → Spectate**, paste the Room ID, and click **Launch**.
- **Private** rooms are not spectatable from the Lobby/Start Page without a secret watch link.

To share a private spectate link, a seated player can use **Info → Online → Ⓦ** (copy watch link).

Note: when joining, the Start Page will auto-open the correct variant page for that room.

Alternative: use the Start Page **Lobby** section to see open rooms and click **Join** on a row (auto-fills the Room ID and launches).

##### Leaving an online game

- If you want to leave cleanly and release your seat, use the in-game **Leave room (forfeit)** button. It confirms first, then ends the game immediately (counts as resign) and returns you to the Start Page.
- If you simply close the tab, the server starts a disconnect grace period (default ~2 minutes).
  - If your opponent is still connected when grace expires, you lose by disconnect timeout.
  - If **both players are disconnected**, the game stays paused and does not time out (so you can resume later).

##### Resuming later

- Same browser: use Start Page **Online → Rejoin room (this browser)** (uses saved seat/player ID).
- Different browser/device: keep the URL containing your **roomId** + **playerId** (your seat credential) and open it later.

##### Online troubleshooting

- **Ports already in use**: the online client uses `8080` and the online server uses `8788`. If `npm run online:dev` fails to start, stop anything else listening on those ports.
  - Windows PowerShell example:
    - `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8788,8080 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty OwningProcess -Unique`
    - `Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force`
- **Client is on 8081 (or similar)**: Vite will automatically choose a new port if `8080` is busy. Check the terminal output for the actual client URL.
- **Changes not taking effect**: make sure you restarted the online server (and client) after pulling new code; stale node processes can keep old behavior running.
- **Room ID copy doesn’t work**: clipboard writes usually require a secure context (HTTPS or `http://localhost`) and may prompt for permission. If the button fails, you can still select/copy the Room ID text manually.
- **Testing from a phone on your LAN**: run `npm run online:dev:lan`, then open `http://<your-lan-ip>:8080/` from your phone (same Wi‑Fi). The server still runs on `8788`.
- **Joined the wrong variant**: always join from the Start Page’s **Online → Join** flow. Opening a variant page directly (e.g. `src/lasca.html`) and then trying to “join” a room from another variant can cause confusing behavior.
- **Opponent’s moves don’t show up**: refresh the page and confirm both players are pointing at the same **Server URL** on the Start Page. Some networks/extensions can interfere with Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Alternatively, you can open `src/lasca.html` directly to jump straight into the game.

### Basic Rules

- **Movement**: Soldiers move forward diagonally one square. Officers move diagonally in any direction.
- **Captures**: Pieces jump over enemy pieces diagonally, landing two squares away. (In Lasca/Damasca, captured pieces stack under the capturer; in Dama, captured pieces are removed.)
- **Promotion**: Soldiers promote to Officers at the end of the turn. During capture chains, the piece continues as a Soldier; if it reaches the far edge at any point in the chain, it promotes when the chain ends.
- **Multi-captures**: If more captures are available, you must continue capturing.
- **Mandatory Capture**: If captures are available, you must capture.
- **Anti-loop Rule**: During multi-capture, you cannot jump over the same square twice.

### Winning

You win when your opponent has:

- No pieces on top of any stacks, OR
- No legal moves available

For detailed rules and strategy tips, see [Help](src/help.html).

If you want help using the Start Page itself (launcher UI), see [Start Page Help](src/start-help.html).

### AI and Evaluation

- **AI (Game Panel → AI):** Set Light and/or Dark to an AI difficulty. If both sides are AI, the game can auto-play.
- **Speed:** Adjusts the pause between AI moves.
- **Pause / Step:** Pause AI play, or step a single move when both sides are AI.
- **Evaluation (Info panel → Evaluation):** Choose what to display using the icon buttons (hover for tooltips):
  - ⚖ Advantage (estimate)
  - ▦ Controlled stacks
  - ⛀ Material (all pieces)

### Move Notation and Export

#### Move History Display

The Move History section (in the Info panel, below the Lasca Stack Inspector) shows each move in algebraic notation.

- Click any entry (including "Start") to jump to that point in the game.
- When you Undo/Redo or jump, the list scrolls to keep the current entry visible.
- When you play moves normally, it auto-scrolls so the latest move stays visible.

- **Quiet moves**: `1. ⚪ D3 → E4` (start → destination)
- **Captures**: `1. ⚫ F6 × E5` (using × symbol)
- **Multi-captures**: `2. ⚪ D3 × F5 × H7` (full path when available)

Move numbers follow chess convention: each full turn (Light + Dark) is one move number.

#### Export Move History

Click "Export Move History" to download a JSON file containing all moves:

```json
{
  "game": "Lasca",
  "date": "2025-12-24T10:30:00.000Z",
  "moves": [
    {
      "moveNumber": 1,
      "player": "Light",
      "notation": "D3 → E4"
    },
    {
      "moveNumber": 1,
      "player": "Dark",
      "notation": "F6 × E5"
    }
  ]
}
```

This format is useful for:

- Recording games for publication
- Analyzing game patterns
- Sharing games with other players
- Potential import into other Lasca game engines

## Notes

- The default entry HTML is `src/index.html` (Start Page), which loads `src/indexMain.ts`.
- The Lasca game page is `src/lasca.html`, which loads `src/main.ts`.
- If you prefer, you can also open `src/lasca.html` directly in a browser, but using a local server avoids potential file URL quirks.

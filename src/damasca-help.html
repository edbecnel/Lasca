      <h2 id="overview">Rules Overview</h2>
      <div class="rule-box">
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Soldiers:</strong> quiet move diagonally forward 1 square.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Officers:</strong> "fly" on quiet moves (slide diagonally
            any distance until blocked).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Captures (Mandatory + Multi-capture + Max-capture)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mandatory:</strong> if any capture exists, you must capture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multi-capture:</strong> after a capture, you must continue
            with the same moving stack until no further captures exist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Max-capture rule:</strong> if multiple capture lines exist,
            only those with the most total captures are legal (choose among
            ties).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anti-loop:</strong> during a capture chain, you cannot jump
            the same square twice.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stacking Capture (Lasca-style)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you jump a stack, you capture only the
            <strong>top</strong> piece of that stack.
          </li>
          <li>
            The captured piece is inserted at the <strong>bottom</strong> of the
            capturing stack.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Promotion</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Promotion happens at <strong>end-of-turn</strong> only.</li>
          <li>
            If a Soldier reaches the far rank during a capture chain, it does
            not promote mid-chain. If it reaches the far rank at any point in
            the chain, it promotes after the chain ends (even if it does not
            finish on the far rank).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 id="lasca-vs-damasca">Lasca vs Damasca</h2>
      <p>
        If you have played <b>Lasca (Classic)</b>, Damasca will feel familiar
        because it also uses <b>stacking captures</b>. The major difference is
        that Damasca uses <b>Dama-style capturing</b>, which makes the game more
        tactical and faster-moving.
      </p>

      <div class="rule-box">
        <h3>Key rule differences</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Board size:</strong> Damasca is played on an
            <strong>8×8</strong> board. Lasca Classic is traditionally played on
            a <strong>7×7</strong> board.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soldier captures:</strong> In Damasca, Soldiers can
            <strong>capture forward or backward</strong> (Dama-style). In Lasca
            Classic, Soldiers capture <strong>forward only</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Officer power:</strong> In Damasca, Officers
            <strong>fly</strong> (long-range diagonal movement and captures). In
            Lasca Classic, Officers move/capture like English draughts
            kings/promoted pieces (non-flying).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Capture choice:</strong> Damasca enforces the
            <strong>maximum-capture</strong> rule. Lasca Classic typically does
            not.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stacking:</strong> Both games keep captured pieces on the
            board as part of stacks. In Damasca, the captured top piece is
            inserted at the <strong>bottom</strong> of the capturing stack.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How it changes the feel</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>More forced tactics earlier:</strong> Because Soldiers can
            capture backward, there are fewer “safe” retreats and more immediate
            counter-captures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Faster turns (especially midgame):</strong> Dama-style
            capture rules tend to create longer, more forced capture lines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Less simplification:</strong> Captures don’t remove material
            — they reshape stacks, so advantage often comes from
            <em>who controls the top pieces</em>, not simply how many pieces
            were taken.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Strategy tips (quick)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan the full capture line:</strong> with max-capture, you
            often win by forcing the opponent into an unfavorable sequence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protect stack tops:</strong> the top piece controls the
            stack; peeling or losing a top can swing control quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Watch backward threats:</strong> Soldiers can punish
            overextended pieces from behind.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 id="damasca-vs-dama">Damasca vs Dama (Filipino Checkers)</h2>
      <p>
        Damasca uses <b>the same movement and capture rules</b> as Dama
        (Filipino Checkers) on an <b>8×8</b> board (mandatory captures,
        multi-capture chains, maximum-capture selection, Soldiers capture
        forward or backward, and Officers have flying movement/capture with the
        no-180° reversal restriction during a chain). If you already know Dama,
        Damasca will feel immediately familiar.
      </p>

      <div class="rule-box">
        <h3>The big difference</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Dama:</strong> Captured pieces are
            <strong>removed</strong> from the board (either immediately or after
            the capture sequence, depending on the chosen rules variant).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Damasca:</strong> Captured pieces are
            <strong>not removed</strong>. Instead, the captured opponent piece
            becomes part of a <strong>stack</strong> under the capturing piece
            (Lasca-style). The captured piece is placed on the
            <strong>bottom</strong> of the capturing stack.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>How it changes the feel</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Game “progress”:</strong> In Dama, trades simplify the board.
          In Damasca, captures usually <em>restructure</em> the board by
          building towers—so the position can stay complex even after big
          capture turns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Momentum swings:</strong> Because only the
          <strong>top</strong> of a stack controls movement, capturing a key
          stack top can flip control quickly without “deleting” everything
          underneath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Endgame texture:</strong> Dama endgames often become sparse
          and technical. Damasca endgames often stay tactically rich because
          stacks keep threats and counter-threats alive.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Strategy shifts (quick)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Material vs top-control:</strong> In Dama you often evaluate
          by piece/man count and king count. In Damasca, raw counts are less
          informative—focus more on
          <strong>who controls key squares</strong> (stack tops), which tops are
          “peelable,” and how safe your tallest stacks are.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Max-capture as engineering:</strong> In Dama, max-capture is
          mainly about winning material. In Damasca, it’s also about the
          <strong>tower you are forced to build</strong> (and the tower you
          might be forcing your opponent to build).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safer sacrifices:</strong> Some sacrifices that are
          permanently costly in Dama can be strategic in Damasca, because
          captured pieces become stack layers that may re-emerge later when
          stack tops are captured.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="setup">Game Setup</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Board: 8×8</li>
        <li>12 pieces per side</li>
        <li>White moves first</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="rules">Game Rules</h2>
      <div class="rule-box">
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Soldiers:</strong> move diagonally forward one square.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Officers:</strong> move diagonally any distance in any
            direction ("flying" officer for both captures and quiet moves).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Promotion</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A soldier promotes to an officer upon reaching the far edge.</li>
          <li>
            Promotion occurs at the end of a capture sequence (no mid-sequence
            officer powers). If a soldier reaches the far edge at any point
            during a capture chain, it promotes after the chain ends (even if it
            does not finish on the far edge).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 id="captures">Captures & Multi-Captures</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        Captures are mandatory when available. If you can continue capturing
        with the same piece, you must continue until no further captures are
        available.
      </div>

      <div class="rule-box">
        <h3>How captures work</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Soldiers:</strong> capture by jumping diagonally over an
            adjacent enemy to the empty square beyond (forward or backward).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Officers:</strong> capture by jumping diagonally over
            exactly one enemy piece and landing on any empty square beyond it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Officer capture direction rule (multi-captures):</strong>
            during a capture chain, an Officer may continue capturing in the
            <strong>same</strong> diagonal direction (0°) or switch to the
            <strong>other</strong> diagonal direction (a ±90° turn), but may
            <strong>not</strong> reverse direction (180°) to capture back the
            way it came.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Choosing among captures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When multiple capture lines exist, the game enforces the
            <strong>maximum-capture</strong> rule: you must choose a capture
            that can result in the greatest total number of captured pieces.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="warning">
        <strong>International note:</strong> In end-of-sequence capture removal,
        jumped pieces stay visible until the sequence ends. The marker indicates
        they are already captured and cannot be jumped again.
      </div>

      <h2 id="interface">Using the Interface</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Click a piece to select it.</li>
        <li>Legal destinations appear as highlighted circles.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Move History:</strong> Click any entry (including "Start") to
          jump to that point in the game. Undo/Redo also navigates through
          history, and the Move History list scrolls to keep the current entry
          visible.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <strong>Dama International</strong> (end-of-sequence capture
          removal), captured-but-not-yet-removed pieces are marked with
          <strong>red circles</strong> to show they are pending removal.
        </li>
        <li>
          During a capture chain, you must continue with the same piece until
          the chain ends.

        <li>
          AI controls can be paused/resumed, and you can use

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mobile:</strong> On touch devices, the ↕️ button near the
          board toggles reduced board height (useful if the bottom navigation
          bar overlaps the board). You can <strong>touch-hold + drag</strong>
          to reposition it.
